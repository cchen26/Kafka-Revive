## About<a name="about"></a>Kafka-Revive

The Kafka-Revive library consists of multiple TypeScript files that provide a comprehensive solution for message re-processing in Apache Kafka using the KafkaJS client. It includes a ClientWrapper class that wraps around the KafkaJS client, allowing the creation of producers and consumers with simplified methods for connecting, subscribing, and processing messages. Additionally, the library provides a DLQManager class for managing Dead Letter Queues (DLQs), enabling the creation of DLQ topics, retrying failed messages, and handling error scenarios.

Please note that Kafka-Revive is not officially associated with Apache Kafka.
