## About<a name="about">Kafka-Revive</a>

The Kafka-Revive library consists of multiple TypeScript files that provide a comprehensive solution for message re-processing in Apache Kafka using the KafkaJS client. It includes a ClientWrapper class that wraps around the KafkaJS client, allowing the creation of producers and consumers with simplified methods for connecting, subscribing, and processing messages. Additionally, the library provides a DLQManager class for managing Dead Letter Queues (DLQs), enabling the creation of DLQ topics, retrying failed messages, and handling error scenarios.

The Kafka-Revive library is an independent message re-processing solution built with TypeScript and the KafkaJS client, offering functionality for handling Apache Kafka messages. Please note that Kafka-Revive is not affiliated with Apache Kafka but provides a wrapper around the KafkaJS client, allowing simplified management of producers, consumers, and Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) for re-processing messages and handling errors in Kafka-based applications.
